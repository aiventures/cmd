# Command Line Tools

``utils.sh``: A couple of helper functions to make work on the command line 
more effective (at least for me). 

Needed to replace complicated bash commands and programming commands by easy to memorize aliases and functions.
Also leverages the great todo.txt command line client. Was written with Windows as OS in mind.

All you need to know is described in this document:
